      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    </header>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is a way of looking at web design with the priority of ensuring that the site both runs on as many devices as possible and that the quality of the core content will be preserved at every level of access. To reference the analogies from the articles, the content of the site should be solid HTML that forms the candy center in one comparison or, in the other article, basic functions of a car, such as safety and mobility. The CSS and JavaScript should be seen as additional features that make the site more appealing to users with high-functioning browsers and devices, but should not provide any vital content that people with older browsers or mobile devices will miss out on. With progressive enhancement in mind, web developers should start building with the weakest devices, smartphones, in mind, and then add some extra functionality for the most modern browsing experience. This is opposed to graceful degradation which generally aims to go back after a site is built for modern, high-capability browsers and make the site work for older or weaker browser options as well. In progressive enhancement, it is very important to separate the roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If the site is built around a strong HTML structure that does not rely on help from CSS or JS to be readable, then adding further functionality to the site for more advanced browsers should not impact the experience for those on outdated and weaker technology. Progressive enhancement is the better model for future-proofing sites so that additional functions may be added as new plug-ins and extensions become available without having to return to the core content and update it to remain functional. With progressive enhancement in mind, users on any device and browser should feel that they are receiving the best experience reasonable for the technology that they are using to view the site.</p>

      <h2>Reflections on Dragon Revisions</h2>
      <p>My first version of the SpaceX Dragon website was pretty barebones. I used the collapsing buttons we learned how to make in the CSS demo project, but there wasn’t a lot of style past that. I showed the project to my wife and she had a few pointers that helped me get a better idea of what makes someone enjoy a website. For one, she wanted a more vibrant color scheme. She suggested the 80s/90s blue and pink color scheme that used to be on the soda cups and everywhere else. She said it reminded her of a retro space vibe. I was concerned that the bright colors would clash or look too much like some basic HTML website from the 90s, but I think by adding in some background images and fading the opacity in places the bright colors didn’t seem so jarring. She appreciated the white text on the dark background, as it made it easier to read with her astigmatism. That seemed like an important note to keep in mind for accessibility. My wife also suggested a landing page. She didn’t like seeing too much text when she first landed on the site. I didn’t think a landing page really fit the criteria of the assignment so I didn’t add it. However, if I did, I would have probably just expanded the top banner to take up a full screen.</p>
      <p>I made a lot of little tweaks after looking at it myself. I put a little more padding in the banner and tried to put a little space between the top of the page and the first paragraph. I put the javascript slideshow on the history page, just to make the page seem a little more expansive and alive. The frequently asked questions page remained fairly bland, but my wife assured me that the consistent, generic style increased readability and would keep readers from getting confused. I added a lot more IDs to various articles to make for easy targeting. I tried to give each section its own style without deviating from the overall layout. I put a background image on the homepage with an opaque background color behind the pictures and texts and I think that worked really well. My wife liked seeing the stars throughout the page. I made a couple different table layouts that I think worked well. I was still worried about using the bright colors, but I think it ended up working. Overall, I think if I had more content to add to the pages, the site would look fairly good. I’m certainly happy with the tools I’ve learned throughout this class. Once I get a little free time, I hope to start working on some websites my wife has been needing. I’ll probably need to work on my JavaScript a little, but I think I’ll feel pretty confident building professional looking sites.</p>
