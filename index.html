      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    </header>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is a way of looking at web design with the priority of ensuring that the site both runs on as many devices as possible and that the quality of the core content will be preserved at every level of access. To reference the analogies from the articles, the content of the site should be solid HTML that forms the candy center in one comparison or, in the other article, basic functions of a car, such as safety and mobility. The CSS and JavaScript should be seen as additional features that make the site more appealing to users with high-functioning browsers and devices, but should not provide any vital content that people with older browsers or mobile devices will miss out on. With progressive enhancement in mind, web developers should start building with the weakest devices, smartphones, in mind, and then add some extra functionality for the most modern browsing experience. This is opposed to graceful degradation which generally aims to go back after a site is built for modern, high-capability browsers and make the site work for older or weaker browser options as well. In progressive enhancement, it is very important to separate the roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If the site is built around a strong HTML structure that does not rely on help from CSS or JS to be readable, then adding further functionality to the site for more advanced browsers should not impact the experience for those on outdated and weaker technology. Progressive enhancement is the better model for future-proofing sites so that additional functions may be added as new plug-ins and extensions become available without having to return to the core content and update it to remain functional. With progressive enhancement in mind, users on any device and browser should feel that they are receiving the best experience reasonable for the technology that they are using to view the site.</p>
